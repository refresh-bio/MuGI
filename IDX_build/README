To build the INDEX_build sources, the Intel Threading Building Blocks library is needed. 

It can be downloaded from: https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org

Example instuction to install the included tbb:

cd tbb/
make clean
make
cd build/linux_intel64_gcc_cc4.6.2_libc2.14.90_kernel3.6.10_release/
source tbbvars.sh  #source tbbvars.csh
cd ../../../

More instruction on how to use the library are also available at the webpage.

The LIB variable in the Makefile should point to the working library.
