It is a program to preprocess the VCF file fo Y chromosome available from the Phase 1 of the 1000GP to have consistent data with one diploid representation for the whole reference.

It removes the additional (NA21313) individual data and artificially extend the list of genomes described in the VCF file of chromosome Y to be the same as for other chromosomes, that is, to include female individuals. The alleles values are set to zero (reference allele) in the genotype fields.
